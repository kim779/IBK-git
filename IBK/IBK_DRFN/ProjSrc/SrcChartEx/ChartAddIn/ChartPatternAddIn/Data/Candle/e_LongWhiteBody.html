      The Long White Candlestick is a signal indicating strong buying pressure.Long White Candlesticks show strong buying pressure. A longer white candlestick is indicative of the fact that the closing price is further above the opening price. The Long White Candlestick shows that the prices advanced significantly from open to close during the day under strong buying pressure and buyers were aggressive. The Long White Candlestick is generally a bullish pattern, however its position within the broader technical picture is also important. For example; Long White Candlesticks may show a potential turning point or they may show that prices have reached to a support level if they are seen after an extended decline. If a Long White Candlestick is seen after a long and significant rally, it can point out to excessive bullishness in the market that says that prices are at dangerously high levels.
