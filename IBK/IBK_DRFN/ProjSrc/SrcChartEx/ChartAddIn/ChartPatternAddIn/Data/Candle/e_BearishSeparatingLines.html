      This pattern is characterized by a white candlestick in a downtrend, which is followed by a sharply lower gap when market opens next day and shows an opening price equal to the prior day¡¯s opening price and also a lower closing price, which is a Black Opening candlestick.A white real body (especially a relatively long one) is a matter of concern for the shorts during downtrend. It shows that the bulls may be gaining control. However, if the next day opens with a downward gap and an opening price equal to the previous day¡¯s opening price, this reinstates the bear confidence. If furthermore the day closes lower, bears feel even more confident about the fact that the downtrend will continue.</td>
