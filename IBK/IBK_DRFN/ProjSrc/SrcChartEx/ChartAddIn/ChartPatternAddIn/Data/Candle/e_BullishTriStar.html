      The Bullish Tri Star Pattern is a very rare but significant bottom reversal pattern. Three Dojis form this pattern. The middle Doji is a Doji Star.In the case of a Bullish Tri Star Pattern, we have a market, which is in a downtrend for a long time. However the weakening trend shows itself by the fact that the real bodies are probably becoming smaller. The first Doji is a matter of concern. The second Doji clearly indicates that market is losing its direction. Finally, the third Doji warns that the downtrend is over. This pattern indicates too much indecision leading to reversal of positions.
