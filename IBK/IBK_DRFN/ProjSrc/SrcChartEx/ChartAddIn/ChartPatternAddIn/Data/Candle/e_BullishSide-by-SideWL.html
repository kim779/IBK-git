      A white candlestick with an upward gap over another white candlestick is followed in the next day by another similar sized white candlestick. The second and the third days have the same opening price. Such a formation is called a Bullish Side By Side White Lines Pattern.Bullish Side By Side White Lines Pattern appears in a bullish market. The first white candlestick confirms the continuation of the bull market. On the second day, the market opens with an upward gap and it closes at a still higher level. On the third day, the market suddenly opens at a much lower level even as low as the previous day's open. However, the initial selling that causes the lower opening ends quickly and the market again climbs to yet another high. This demonstrates that the bullish move is continuing.
