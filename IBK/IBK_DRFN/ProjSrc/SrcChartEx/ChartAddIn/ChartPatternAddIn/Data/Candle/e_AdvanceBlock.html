      It is a pattern characterized by three long white candlesticks with consecutively higher closes during an uptrend. The Bearish Advance Block Pattern is similar to the Bullish Three White Soldiers Pattern. The difference is the fact that each successive day is weaker than the one preceding it. This may suggest that the rally is losing strength and a reversal is possible.
