      Bullish</strong><br>
      This pattern is highlighted by two consecutive Black Marubozu.
      They are characterized by the fact that a gapping black candlestick trades into the body of the previous day and it is seen during a downtrend. 
      Then there is another Black Marubozu on the third day showing sale of positions since it closes at a new low. However this may give incentive to the shorts to cover their positions implying that a bullish reversal is now possible.Two black Marubozu show that downtrend is continuing to the satisfaction of the bears. On the third day, we see a downward gap further confirming the downtrend. However, prices on the third day start going above the close of the previous day causing some doubts about the bearish direction even though the day closes at or near its low. The next day shows us a significantly higher gap in the opening. After the opening, however, prices again go down closing at a new low. This last day may be interpreted as a good chance for the short-sellers to cover their short positions.
