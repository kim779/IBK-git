      This pattern is characterized by three adjacent black and long candlesticks terminated by a white candlestick driving prices back to the point where they were at the beginning of the pattern. If there was a strong bearish trend before the pattern, then it should continue.The Bearish Three Line Strike Pattern appears during a downtrend as evidenced by the three black candlesticks. We see an opening on the fourth day that opens in the direction of the downtrend, but now shorts start covering their positions causing the prices to move strongly in the opposite direction. This may lead to doubts about market direction. However it is also a fact that this move completely eradicated the move of the previous three days. So this day should be looked upon as a day that gave the shorts the chance of being covered and if the bearish trend was strong before the pattern, the downward move should continue.
