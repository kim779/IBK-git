      A White candlestick is followed by a sharply lower gap when it opens during the second day. The second day opening is even below the prior session¡¯s opening (forming a Black candlestick).Bearish Kicking Pattern sends a strong signal suggesting that the market is now heading downward. The previous market direction is not important in this pattern unlike most other candlestick patterns. The market has been in a trend when prices gap down the next day in case of Bearish Kicking Pattern. The prices on the second day never enter into the previous day's range and we have a close with another gap.</td>
