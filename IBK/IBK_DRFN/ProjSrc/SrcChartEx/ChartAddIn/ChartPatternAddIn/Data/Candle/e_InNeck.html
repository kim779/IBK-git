      Bearish In Neck Pattern is characterized by a white candlestick that has a closing price slightly above the previous black candlestick¡¯s low during a downtrend. If the white candlestick¡¯s low is broken down, the downtrend continues.The Bearish In Neck Pattern is an undeveloped version of the Bullish Piercing Line Pattern with a much lower close. The white body on second day closes near the close of the previous black day, at the lower part of the body. The actual definition requires a closing price just inside the previous day's body and slightly above its close. So it is a higher close than the Bearish On Neck Pattern, but not much.
