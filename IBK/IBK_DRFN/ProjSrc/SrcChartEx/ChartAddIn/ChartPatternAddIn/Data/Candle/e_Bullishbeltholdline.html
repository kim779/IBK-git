      The Bullish Belt Hold Pattern is a single candlestick pattern.
      It is basically a White Opening Marubozu that occurs in a downtrend.
      As such; it opens on its low, then we see a rally during the day against 
      the overall trend of the market, and then the day closes near its
      high but not necessarily at its high. 
      If Belt Hold lines are characterized by longer bodies, then it means that they offer more resistance to the trend they are countering.
