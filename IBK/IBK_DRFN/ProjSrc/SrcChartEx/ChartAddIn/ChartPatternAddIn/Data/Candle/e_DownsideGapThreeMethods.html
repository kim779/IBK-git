      Two long black candlesticks with a downward gap between them appear.
      They are followed on the third day with a white candlestick, which manages to close the gap between the first two. This should be seen as a support for the downward trend.The Bearish Downside Gap Three Methods Pattern appears when the market is moving strongly downward. Downward move is extended further by another day showing a gap in the direction of the downtrend. The third day opening is well within the body of the second day, and it manages to completely fill the gap. This gap-closing move may be interpreted as a support level for the current downtrend.
