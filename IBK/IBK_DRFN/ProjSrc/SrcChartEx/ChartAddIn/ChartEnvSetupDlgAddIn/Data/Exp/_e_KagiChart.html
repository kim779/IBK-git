              Due to its effectiveness in showing a clear path of price movements, the Kagi chart is one of the various charts that investors use to make better decision on the stocks. The most important benefit of this chart is that it is independent of time and change of direction occurs only when a specific amount is reached.</p>

            <p>The thickness of the line changes when the price reaches the high or low of the previous vertical line. 
The direction of the line changes when the price reaches a preset reversal amount, which is usually set at 3 units. When a direction change occurs, a short horizontal line is drawn between the lines of opposite direction. 
Alternatively, thin and thick lines can be replaced with lines of different colours.

                   1.Find the starting point. The starting point is generally considered the first closing price. From this point forward, you compare each day's closing price with the starting price. 
               <br>2.Draw a thin vertical line from the starting price to each day's closing price, while the trend does not reverse. 
               <br>3.If a day's closing price moves in the opposite direction to the trend by more than the reversal amount, draw a short horizontal line and a new vertical line, beginning from the horizontal line to the new closing price. 
               <br>4.If the price on a day is greater than or equal to the previous high, change to a thick line and continue the vertical line. If the price on that day is less than or equal to the previous low, then change to a thin line. </p>
